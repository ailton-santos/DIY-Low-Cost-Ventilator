# 3D models 

## Requirements & recommendations

**Supported file formats**

- STL - for 3D printed models
- STEP - for objects representing part to be used as a reference
- Application specific projects (like SolidWorks, Fusion360) - CAD formats other users could edit 

**Unsupported file formats**
- Mesh-based objects (.obj, .3dmax, etc) - these formats are not editable by CAD software and should be avoided.

**3D printing recommendations:**

1. Part dimensions should be within 200x200x200mm - print area limits for most 3D printers
2. Avoid overhangs - parts should be printable without Support
3. For bigger parts please also try to provide stacked version - i.e. parts on top of each other, so we could print them in bulk
4. Recommended print settings should be provided for printing with PET-G (material accepted for medical purposes)
